# Quarto for Reproducible Research

The Quarto half of a 1-hour session for Love Data Week 2024, which will overview Quarto and JupyterLab, two popular tools for integrating code, documentation, and text into reproducible research projects. This workshop will teach you the basics of using Quarto and Jupyter Notebooks to improve the legibility of your code in R, Python, or other programming languages, focusing on features that help you create reproducible research and code for technical and non-technical audiences.
