## Introduction

This is a notebook for the Scurvy Lab at JHU to share code and results.

## Results

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(medicaldata)
library(scales)
library(gt)

scurvy <- medicaldata::scurvy

```

```{r}
scurvy_treatments <- scurvy |> 
  dplyr::group_by(treatment) |>
  dplyr::summarise(success_rate = scales::percent(sum(fit_for_duty_d6 == '1_yes')/n())) #<1>

scurvy_treatments |>
  gt()
```

1.  Calculate the percentage of cases that were cured by each treatment.

## Discussion

In this study, treating scurvy with citrus has a success rate of `r scurvy_treatments |> filter(treatment == 'citrus') |> select(success_rate)`.
